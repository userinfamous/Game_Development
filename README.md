Hello there people, this is vuottek here bringing you this sweet repository so we can brainstorm some ideas in general.
you can create whatever you want inside this repository ranging from story outlines for a game. Which I use to have done so in the past with a friend of mine. We came up with a story about a cat; the game was called the "Adventures of mister cat".
it was never finish due to difficulties with a script I got from some guy. yeah those were the days.



The red parts are the changes
